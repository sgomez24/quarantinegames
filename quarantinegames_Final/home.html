                <p>Given that we are undergoing a global pandemic and are forced to stay home, it can be really hard to find ways to connect with your friends and family. For this reason, we are trying to provide an environment where people can connect and have fun while social distancing. We are a group of students at SFSU that have created an organized and categorized website from an existing google doc full of quarantine games. Please go support the creator of this google doc Nia, her parents were laid off due to the pandemic her venmo and social media is @ihartnia.
